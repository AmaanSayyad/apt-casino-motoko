- 🔄 Real-time updates for bets and game state

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16.x or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v8.x or higher)
- [dfx](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-tools/deploy/install-dfx) (Internet Computer SDK, v0.15.0 or higher)

## Wallet Integration

The casino integrates with Internet Identity for authentication. Follow these steps to connect:

```bash
./transfer-to-user.sh <principal-id> <amount>
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Make sure you have the latest version of dfx installed
2. Check that the local replica is running with `dfx ping`
3. Clear your browser cache
4. Try redeploying the canisters with `dfx deploy --rebuild`
